## Common Sense Statute																									
																									
We're all about having fun here, so our biggest goal is to keep the rules simple and limited. We ask that you don't do things that motivate us to change that. Trying to circumvent the rules through loopholes or arguing over technicalities will likely get you returned to a safehub. Please don't be a pain in the ass. Some rules may not be directly listed as they are considered common sense. Admins may determine you're doing something unacceptable and you will be requested to stop.																									
																									
																									
## The Big Four																									
																									
We believe in giving most people an extra opportunity to show good behavior, when it's warranted, even in spite of previous poor behavior. However, there are some actions that go beyond even our ability to forgive. The following are cases that will result in a permanent ban from all associated regions:																									
																									
- Distribution of identifying real-life information about others, also called "doxxing"																									
- GPU crashing or any other griefing intended to damage a user's real-life PC hardware																								
- Creative content theft and distribution without creator permission (ripping textures, copybotting, abusing permissions bugs, etc)																									
- Abuse of the Linden Labs AR (abuse report) system; that is, a bad-faith attempt to provoke a direct response from LL with the malicious intent to have someone's account suspended or banned.																									
	- This, of course, does not apply for cases where individuals have a good-faith reason to involve LL (for example, continued harassment, threats of real-life violence, or other terms of service infractions.)																								
	- If you are being harrassed specifically, this does not permit nor support the idea of utilizing friends to perform a mass abuse report.																								
																									
## General Conduct																									
These are the rules that cover your own conduct when visiting the sims, if you break these you will be banned.																									
																									
1. **Harassment** 																									
- While some level of competitive shit-talk is acceptable, being toxic crosses the line. If you aren't enjoying yourself, leave. Don't come here just to piss someone off or waste their time.																									
- Targeting someone for their gender, religion, sexual preference or otherwise is not acceptable.																									
																									
2. **Griefing** 																									
- Griefing can be defined as producing any object in-world that intentionally causes script time to bog down or puts a strain on sim and/or users' FPS. Crashing the sim falls under this definition as well.																									
- Threats of griefing will be treated as the action being threatened. We do not negotiate with terrorists													
- This will automatically result in a 24-hour ban, minimum.																									
																									
																									
3. **Disruption & Picketing Rule**																									
- If you or a group has been banned from a region, the other regions are not to be used as your personal soap box.																									
- Attempting to engage or circumvent any administrative action will be handled accordingly.																									
																									
4. **Sithacking**																									
- Sithacking or using personal teleporters to access areas that are otherwise off-limits to the public is not allowed. The first offense will result in being shot. Subsequent offenses will result in offenders being placed on an autokiller or given a temporary timeout off-sim.																									
																									
5. **Safe Zones** 																									
- Marked zones outside of spawns are considered courtesy safe zones, firing out or into them, or utilizing indirect weaponry from within it (Mortars, etc) will result in your safezone being eliminated.																									
- If attackers attempt to rush the spawn immediately on entry to take advantage of a slow defense response, they may be equally rushed.																									
- Skybox areas not marked as being for combat are also considered within this rule, e.g: Build platform, Landing zone, etc.																									
																									
																									
																									
																									
																									
																									
## **Combat Specific Rules**																									
These are the general combat rules for the sim. While this may seem like a lengthy list, exceptions can be made to these on a case by case basis. We are not interested in stifling inovation or preventing anyone from creating awesome things as that is within the spirit of the community and the game itself. Feel free to message a sim admin to see if things are all good!

2. **Client-Side Assists**

If comes to our attention that these tools are being used, you will be asked to disable them, Failure to comply with this request will result in placement on an auto returner or autokiller until compliance is met. Further refusal will result in a temporary timeout or ban.																									
																									
3. **Gun Damage & Reloads**
